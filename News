Docker encapsulation update
- Added more utility functions for Docker management
- Now the Docker images are hosted on DockerHub
- The services use the images from DockerHub
- I tested the system in a swarm with 2 nodes (hosts):
    - One was my laptop, one was my computer (connected in a private network, behind a router)
    - The Docker swarm mode seems to distribute the services' tasks equally to the hosts
    - The Docker load balancer appears to be forwarding requests in a 'round robin' way (exactly as specified in the documentation)
    - Overall the system works just fine on 2 hosts
