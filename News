Crawler update
- Implemented, tested and integrated the following microservices:
    - Spiders
    - SongUrlProcessor
- Still in development:
    - Repository (or repositories if creating a separate one for the crawler)
    - DomainRequestScheduler
    - CrawlerEngine
- Implemented simple Selenium resource obtainer (simply awaits some time for the JS to dynamically update the page then gets the HTML)
- Updated ER and Microservice diagrams
