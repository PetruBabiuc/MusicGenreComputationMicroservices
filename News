Microservice encapsulation in Docker containers
- The microservices can now be deployed in Docker containers (tasks of services of Docker Swarm Mode)
- Created 'dockerfiles', 'requirements.txt' and modules for each microservice in docker_images directory
- Created commands for creating every service needed for the system (docker_images/service_creation_commands)
    - Note that the services communicate through networks of type 'overlay'
- Created microservice docker image template in docker_image_template directory
- Implemented scripts for stopping, starting and resetting the system in the docker_main.py
- There are 2 useful commands:
    - Command to concatenate and tail the microservices' outputs;
    - Command to delete all the containers with the 'Exited' status
