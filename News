- Added OAUTH2 with JWT authentication and authorization for the database API
- Now the passwords are stored as hashes created with Bcrypt hashing algorithm
- Created a database API proxy class that:
    - Encapsulates the communication logic with the database API
    - Acquires/renews JWT from the database using the given credentials
- Secured most of the database API endpoints
- Created automated tests for identity management function and the API proxy
